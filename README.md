#### Project Overview:

# Chill Gamer : A Game Review Platform

Chill Gamer is a user-friendly game review platform designed for gamers to explore, review, and share their experiences with various games. The platform provides an intuitive interface where users can browse game reviews, read ratings, and share their own opinions on their favorite games. The goal of Chill Gamer is to create a community for gamers to connect over shared interests, offer feedback, and help others find the best games to play.

_Users can sign up or log in through email or Google authentication, utilizing Firebase Authentication for secure user management. Upon successful login, user data is stored in MongoDB, allowing users to access personalized game reviews and preferences. MongoDB handles user profiles, reviews, and other related data, ensuring a smooth experience while browsing, submitting, and managing game reviews on the platform._
